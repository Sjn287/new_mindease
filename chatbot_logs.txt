Bot Reply: I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling sad. It's completely normal to experience a range of emotions, and it takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share your feelings.

Firstly, please know that you're not alone in this feeling. Sadness is a common and valid emotion that can affect anyone, regardless of their background, circumstances, or personality. It's okay to feel sad, and it doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with you.

Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on that's making you feel sad? Is it related to a specific event, person, or situation, or is it more of a general feeling? Sometimes talking about what's on your mind can help you process and release some of those emotions.

Remember, I'm here to listen and support you without judgment. You're safe to share as much or as little as you like.
